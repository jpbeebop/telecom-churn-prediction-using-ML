"#telecom-churn-prediction-using-ML" 

Predict the churn rate of a fictional telecom company using Machine Learning techniques such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge Classifier
- SVM
- AdaBoosting
- Gradient Boosting
- XGB
- Light GBM
  
dataset used is secondaray dataset from Kaggle: WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv

All work execution of data preprocessing and model development can be read in Telecom Churn Prediction.ipynb.

Best model is AdaBoost classifier with feature selection using ANOVA.
